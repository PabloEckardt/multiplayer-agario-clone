See original source material from Tech With Tim https://github.com/techwithtim/Agar-IO

This extension of the original source is intended to implement:
 
1) web sockets over the internet and not just local networks.

2) detach the UI keyEvents and attach a queue like system to program blobs instead of controlling them manually

3) be ran on browser IDEs that support Pygame i.e. Repl.it

clients need game.py and client.py

server requires server.py
